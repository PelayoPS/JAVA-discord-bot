# Welcome to JAVA_discord_bot docs contributing guide
Thank you for being interested in contributing to the project, at this moment to help with the development of the bot you have to write a message to the Author via discord
or to use the discussion threads that are enabled after each release.

## New contributor guide
In order to contribute to the project you will have to follow the next steps:
  -Follow the setup guide to clone the repo and get all the dependencies ready
  -Send a message to the original author to show what you can change
  -All the commits will be done by the original author in the branch master, but you can fork the repo and do your own work
  -When developing without supervision your code must be sent to review before uploading it to the main branch
  
## Set up guide
   -The project has been developed since the start using the intellj ide for java development, but you can use the one you want
   -To install all the dependencies use maven or translate the pom.xml to the dependency manager you want to use
   -To be able to work on the code you will need to have some knowledge in java
   -All the code is documented with javadoc, so you won't have problems understanding how methods work
   -The jdk used is the java 17
   -You have to fill in with your own data the .env that is given as example because the author values won't be shared at any point in the development
   -Send a message in discord to the author and join the development server as it will be the main way to communicate
